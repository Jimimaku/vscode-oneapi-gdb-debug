## How to use IntelliSense for oneAPI Code
 1. Make sure that the [C/C++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) is already installed.
 2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and choose the option `C/C++ Edit Configurations (JSON)`. As a result, a c_cpp_properties.json file will be created in .vscode folder.
 3. Edit the file so that it looks like in the example:
 ```
    {
    "configurations": [
            {
                "name": "Linux",
                "includePath": [
                    "${workspaceFolder}/**",
                    "/opt/intel/oneapi/**"
                ],
                "defines": [],
                "compilerPath": "/opt/intel/oneapi/compiler/latest/linux/bin/dpcpp",
                "cStandard": "c17",
                "cppStandard": "c++17",
                "intelliSenseMode": "linux-clang-x64"
            }
        ],
        "version": 4
            }
```
4. If necessary, replace the path to the oneAPI components with the one that is relevant for your installation folder.
5. IntelliSense for oneAPI is ready.
